          <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p class="skill-row">I have over a decade of experience working in IT as a Sr Web Developer at a University in Ontario.
            I left IT to move into <a href="https://sherrisimpson.com/">entrepreneurship</a>, learning a great deal about myself, 
            and online business. I am in the process of re-educating myself with the latest in web development.

            <h3>Sr. Web Developer, University of Windsor, Dec. 2000 to Aug. 2011</h3>
            <p>I worked with Lotus Notes and Domino Designer to help build the campus websites,
                and taught faculty and staff members how to edit their own sites.
            </p>  
             <p>In the final few years of this position, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP to help 
                <br>graduate students, teaching them how to create online forms to collect data for their theses.
